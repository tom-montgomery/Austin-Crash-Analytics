# Austin-Crash-Analytics
Mapping project to analyze and predict crash patterns in Austin, Texas

This project aims to combine data from Texas Department of Transportation's Crash Records Information System (CRIS) with spatial and machine learning techniques to analyze crash patterns in Austin Texas, and hopefully predict areas and times of high crash probability.




# Prototypes:

These maps show prototypes of the sort of spatial analysis that is possible for the CRIS data. 

San Antonio Crash Map:
This map focuses on alcohol and drug related crashes in San Antonio by finding the intersections where the most of these crashes occur. Data was prepped from CRIS 2010-2017 with drugs and alcohol flagged as contributing factors.

Bexar Crash Map:
This map shows intersections with the highest counts of crashes of any type. Also of interest is the calculation of mean (most common) crash times, days, and years to help elucidate patterns.
